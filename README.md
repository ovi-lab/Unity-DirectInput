This package allows you to easily integrate both the input and ForceFeedback features of DirectX DirectInput from within Unity. This allows you to interface with HID peripherals with ForceFeedback capabilities. This can be used to build vivid simulated experiences.

The package will create a virtual device inside Unity's Input System. This device can then be used like any other device inside the Input System, allowing for easy rebinding. ForceFeedback capabilites can be accessed via the DIManager class. The [DirectInputExplorer](../../tree/main/DirectInputExplorer~) is a Windows forms application built in parallel with the C++ library to enable quick development by avoiding the need to reload Unity after every change. It also functions as an easy way to examine DirectInput devices.

# Quick Start

### Installation

This package requires the use of Unity's new Input System, to ensure [com.unity.inputsystem](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/manual/QuickStartGuide.html) is installed in the project. Install it via the package manager via: 

`Window -> Package Manager => Input System`

Next, install (copy and paste) this repo's Plugin folder into your Unity project's Assets folder. You can copy and paste the whole content, and Unity will automatically exclude the unrelated contents as their folder names have "~" characters. Those unrelated folders have the source code of the native Direct Input FFB DLL that Unity uses. Open the Sample Scene and play the scene to start working with this asset. The sample scene has one Direct Input with Force Feed Back support and an example script to read the input values.

Note that everything is adjustable in the native DLL, And the Custom Force effect exists but has not been fully done.

## Compatible Devices
### Note that all the devices that use Direct Input (from the old Logitech G wheels to the advanced Simcube ones) should work
The community has tested and verified these devices do indeed work. Albeit not all devices support all the FFB effects!

Note for pedals, only input readings were guaranteed to *likely* work fine.

## Environment

# Notices

1) Occasionally calls to EnumerateDevices will take orders of magnitude longer than usual to execute (up to 60 seconds), this is caused by a Windows bug attempting to load an absent hardware device. USB Audio DACs & Corsair keyboards are known the cause this issue, try disconnecting and reconnecting offending USB devices. For more information see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10967795/directinput8-enumdevices-sometimes-painfully-slow) StackOverflow post about the issue from 2012. See issue [#1](https://github.com/MrTimcakes/Unity-DirectInput/issues/1) for more info.

2) THE UNITY INTEGRATION HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED TO THE LATEST VERSION IN THIS REPOSITORY.
